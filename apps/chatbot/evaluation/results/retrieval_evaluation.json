        "Our mission at what3words is to become the global standard for addressing. Street addresses weren’t designed for 2025. They aren’t accurate enough to specify building entrances, and they don’t exist for parks, rural areas and many parts of the world. This makes it hard to find places and causes problems and inefficiencies on a global scale.\n That’s why we created what3words. We divided the world into 3m squares and gave each square a unique combination of three words. It’s the easiest way to find and share precise locations.\n In late 2024, we welcomed Swiftcomplete into the what3words family. Their expertise in fast, intelligent, and scalable address validation technology strengthens our ability to make location data even more accessible, accurate, and easy to use. Together, we’re building the most powerful addressing standard and address validation products in the world.\n Over the last year, what3words has been used in 193 countries, and our monthly active users continue to grow at an impressive pace. Our tech is used by emergency services, delivery companies, eCommerce businesses, ride-hailing apps and NGOs, and is integrated into the navigation systems of millions of cars around the world.\n\nWho we’re looking for\n\nWe are looking for a Full Stack Staff Engineer to join our growing team of 25+ engineers in Ho Chi Minh City to own end‑to‑end delivery of an address autocomplete & validation app for Shopify, focusing on Checkout UI Extensions and app Admin configuration. This is an independent role (architecture → code → release). Work closely with Swiftcomplete Product Managers—who define scope & functionality—and co‑design based on your expertise.\n\nCollaboration with Product Management\n\nYou’ll work closely with Swiftcomplete Product Managers who own scope and business outcomes. They will collaborate with you in the design process and expect you to contribute options and trade‑offs based on your engineering experience."
