They aren’t accurate enough to specify building entrances, and they don’t exist for parks, rural areas and many parts of the world. This makes it hard to find places and causes problems and inefficiencies on a global scale.\n That’s why we created what3words. We divided the world into 3m squares and gave each square a unique combination of three words. It’s the easiest way to find and share precise locations.\n In late 2024, we welcomed Swiftcomplete into the what3words family. Their expertise in fast, intelligent, and scalable address validation technology strengthens our ability to make location data even more accessible, accurate, and easy to use. Together, we’re building the most powerful addressing standard and address validation products in the world.\n Over the last year, what3words has been used in 193 countries, and our monthly active users continue to grow at an impressive pace. Our tech is used by emergency services, delivery companies, eCommerce businesses, ride-hailing apps and NGOs, and is integrated into the navigation systems of millions of cars around the world.\n\nWho we’re looking for\n\nWe are looking for a Full Stack Staff Engineer to join our growing team of 25+ engineers in Ho Chi Minh City to own end‑to‑end delivery of an address autocomplete & validation app for Shopify, focusing on Checkout UI Extensions and app Admin configuration.

They aren’t accurate enough to specify building entrances, and they don’t exist for parks, rural areas and many parts of the world. This makes it hard to find places and causes problems and inefficiencies on a global scale.\n That’s why we created what3words. We divided the world into 3m squares and gave each square a unique combination of three words. It’s the easiest way to find and share precise locations.\n In late 2024, we welcomed Swiftcomplete into the what3words family. Their expertise in fast, intelligent, and scalable address validation technology strengthens our ability to make location data even more accessible, accurate, and easy to use. Together, we’re building the most powerful addressing standard and address validation products in the world.\n Over the last year, what3words has been used in 193 countries, and our monthly active users continue to grow at an impressive pace.
