In a $600 billion global lodging and meetings market, inefficiencies are rampant—from frustrating traveler experiences caused by outdated check-in and payment systems to millions lost annually due to missing or non-compliant invoices that block VAT reclaim. With travel increasingly complex and fragmented, the opportunity for innovation is enormous—and HRS is leading the charge. \n HRS offers an unparalleled end-to-end solution for managing corporate lodging, group travel, long stay, and meetings—all within a single, unified platform. With HRS Connect, companies gain access to a sleek, consumer-grade booking interface that consolidates fragmented travel spend and delivers full visibility across all travel categories. This is paired with HRS’s proprietary AI Copilot, which enables travel and procurement leaders to steer their programs strategically with real-time data, actionable insights, and one-click implementation of optimizations. \n Together, these solutions empower organizations to drive measurable cost savings, boost policy compliance, and radically improve the traveler experience. The HRS platforms enable customers to achieve up to 3x return on investment, achieve close to 100% invoice compliance, and increase corporate program adoption by over 20% — which is particularly relevant in unmanaged spend areas like meetings and groups.   \n With over two decades of proprietary data, market-leading AI, and deep integration across the travel and expense ecosystem, HRS powers travel programs for 35% of the Fortune 500. From seamless payment to e-invoicing to VAT reclaim, HRS offers unmatched transparency, governance, and performance — turning travel into a data-driven advantage with a sharp focus on customer excellence, compliance, and automation. \n BUSINESS UNIT\nSearch & Book is at the core of HRS’s value proposition - simplifying how employees book hotels and meeting spaces, increasing program adoption, and delivering full transparency across lodging and meetings spend. Key HRS innovations such as AI-powered search, real-time rate validation, and multi-source content integration ensure travelers always see the most relevant, compliant, and cost-effective options. \n These capabilities not only improve traveler satisfaction and policy compliance but also play a central role in enabling HRS’s go-to-market strategy. Search & Book strengthens our global content ecosystem—unlocking network effects that drive scalability, data quality, and continuous optimization across the platform.
