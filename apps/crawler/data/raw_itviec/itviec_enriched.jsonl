THE ROLE OVERVIEW\nWe are seeking a Technical Product Owner to serve as the primary bridge between our US Product Team and the Vietnam Engineering Team. This is a dynamic, high-impact role that requires wearing multiple hats: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Project Manager. You will not just manage a backlog; you will own the delivery of a complex healthcare product that supports children with autism. Our US Partner “Cloud Kinetix” is proud to be the technology hub for a U.S.-based healthcare company pioneering software solutions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD). Our lean engineering team in Vietnam collaborates directly with product and engineering leaders in the U.S. to create smart, secure, and scalable clinical platforms. \n 2. WORKING SCHEDULE & EXPECTATIONS (Please Read Carefully)\nTo ensure effective collaboration with the US team, this position operates on a specific schedule. We value transparency and want to ensure this aligns with your lifestyle before you apply:\nEarly Schedule: Work starts at 6:00 AM (Vietnam Time) on remote days (Tue-Fri) to facilitate direct syncs with US stakeholders.\nCritical Availability: While we respect personal time, this role requires a \"First Responder\" mindset. Late evening meetings (up to 11:00 PM) may occur occasionally (1-2 times/month) to resolve critical issues. In these instances, your leadership and presence are required.\nHybrid Model: Monday at the office (Binh Thanh Dist) for team alignment; Tuesday through Friday are remote.\n3.

We expect you to use technology to work faster and smarter.\nB. Process & Delivery Management (60%)\n• Scrum Master Role: Facilitate stand-ups, proactively identify blockers, and ensure the Engineering team has everything they need to run smoothly.\n• Project Manager Role: Monitor timelines, manage risks, and provide transparent status reports to the Director of Operations.
